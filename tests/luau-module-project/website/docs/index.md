# Bakerywave Test Benchmark

This site is an integration benchmark used to verify all major `bakerywave` features (theme, doc generation, search, and more).

## 🚀 Main Test Areas

- **[Feature Showcase](/features-showcase)**: Review all major tags and signatures supported by the doc generator.
- **[API Reference](/reference/luau)**: Explore class docs generated from real Luau source code.
- **[Tags Test](/luau-tags-test)**: Validate tag rendering in manually written MDX files.
- **[Links Test](/luau-links)**: Validate internal doc links and external project links.

This site is not for production deployment and is only used for development and validation.
All document text and code samples are designed to measure how accurately `bakerywave` reproduces the Roblox documentation style.
